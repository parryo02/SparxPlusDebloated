## Features

* Supports SparxMaths
  * Fully configurable settings, available in the settings tab
  * A native (albeit experimental) dark mode
  * Progressive Disclosure, a feature which hides tasks that you aren't currently doing, and the amount of tasks
  * Whiteboard (To do working out)

## Why is this code open-source?

Due to the nature of Sparx, it requires a login. These logins require you to be a part of an academy which pays Sparx-Learning for accounts, and you must be provided a login to properly test this extension. This means that, especially for the Chrome Web Store (sorry guys im not giving you my account details), it's harder to test the extension.

In order to make sure that people feel comfortable using this extension, I have made the source code of this extension fully open source, under GPL-3.0 (meaning forks must also have the same license), so the code can be audited and checked for the skeptical like me.

It's also open-source, because I like open-source code :)
